Examples in both the Linear Regression model notebook and the Neural Network model notebook runs and trains on a particular dataset called the concrete dataset 
which is in the concrete.csv datafile. It also uses the iris dataset in iris.csv.

Running main.py gives you access to a Neural Network application with a GUI built using Tkinter.
