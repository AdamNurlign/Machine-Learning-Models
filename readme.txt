Hello!

This is version 1 of a very simple neural network application which allows you to design, create, and train your own custom neural network architectures to make inferences on.

Currently it supports regression and classification tasks.

To use the application you want to run main.py and make sure you upload a .csv dataset file to the directory which you are launching the app from.

Enjoy!
